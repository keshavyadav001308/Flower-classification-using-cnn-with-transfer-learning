 Models Used
- CNN from scratch  
- Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)  
- Transfer Learning with Fine-Tuning  

Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|------|----------|
| CNN from Scratch | 81.98% |
| Transfer Learning | 85.42% |
| Transfer Learning + Fine-Tuning | **88.01%** |

Technologies
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

 Conclusion
